<h1 align="center">Cybersecurity Home Lab:</h1>

As part of my learning experience at TKH, I designed and implemented a Cybersecurity Home Lab to demonstrate my knowledge and technical skills. I used Linux Terminal Operations, Networking Fundamentals, and Cybersecurity Concepts and Tools to set up a secure home network. 

In this Project I had learned how to create a cybersecurity home-lab from scratch. I used Gliffy to create a network diagram that showed the topology and configuration of my security home lab. Also, I use VirtualBox to run Ubuntu desktop as your host machine and install pfSense as a firewall to protect your network simulations.I used configure Snort as an intrusion detection system and use Splunk as a security information and event management (SIEM) tool, use Metasploitable2 as target/victim Virtual machine. Finally,I had set up Kali Linux as an attacker machine to perform various penetration testing scenarios.
